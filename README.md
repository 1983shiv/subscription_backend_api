## Overview

This project is a **Backend API** for a **Subscription Model** with **authentication**.

### Tech Stack:
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB** with **Mongoose**
- **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
- **MVC** (Model-View-Controller) design pattern
- **Middleware** for authentication and authorization

---

## Setup Instructions

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository** to your computer:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1983shiv/subscription_backend_api.git

    cd subscription_backend_api
    npm install
    npm dev
    ```

## API Routes

Below is a list of all the available API routes, organized by their function. All the routes in the application use JWT-based authentication and authorization through middleware.

### Authentication Routes (authRouter)
- POST /api/v1/auth/sign-up - Sign up a new user
- POST /api/v1/auth/sign-in - Sign in an existing user
- POST /api/v1/auth/sign-out - Sign out the current user

### User Routes (userRouter)
- GET /api/v1/users/ - Get a list of all users (authorized)
- GET /api/v1/users/:id - Get a specific user's details (authorized)
- POST /api/v1/users/ - Create a new user (admin route)
- PUT /api/v1/users/:id - Update a specific user's details (admin route)
- DELETE /api/v1/users/:id - Delete a user (admin route)

### Subscription Routes (subscriptionRouter)
CRUD operations for subscriptions:
- GET /api/v1/subscriptions/ - Get all subscriptions for the authenticated user (authorized)

- GET /api/v1/subscriptions/upcoming-renewal - Get all upcoming renewal subscriptions for the authenticated user (authorized)

- GET /api/v1/subscriptions/:id - Get a specific subscription by ID (authorized)

- GET /api/v1/subscriptions/user/:id - Get all subscriptions for a specific user (authorized)

- POST /api/v1/subscriptions/ - Create a new subscription for the authenticated user (authorized)

### Subscription management routes:

- PUT /api/v1/subscriptions/:id/cancel - Cancel a specific subscription (authorized)
- PUT /api/v1/subscriptions/:id/renew - Renew a specific subscription (authorized)
- PUT /api/v1/subscriptions/:id/change-plan - Change the subscription plan (e.g., upgrading or downgrading).

### Other routes:

- PUT /api/v1/subscriptions/:id/update-details - Update the details of a subscription (name, payment method, etc.)
- PUT /api/v1/subscriptions/:id - Update a subscription (can be customized for further updates)
- DELETE /api/v1/subscriptions/:id - Delete a specific subscription (authorized)

## Controllers and Functions
Each route is associated with a corresponding controller function. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key controller functions used in the routes:

### Authentication Controller
- signUp(req, res, next): Handles user registration and creates a new user in the database.
- signIn(req, res, next): Handles user login, generates a JWT token, and authenticates the user.
- signOut(req, res, next): Handles user logout by invalidating the current JWT token.
User Controller
- getUsers(req, res, next): Fetches a list of all users from the database (for admin).
- getUser(req, res, next): Fetches a specific user's details by user ID.
- updateUser(req, res, next): Updates a specific user's details by user ID.
- deleteUser(req, res, next): Deletes a specific user from the database.

### Subscription Controller
- getAllSubscriptions(req, res, next): Fetches all subscriptions associated with the authenticated user.
- getUpcomingRenewals(req, res, next): Fetches all subscriptions that are due for renewal.
- getSubscription(req, res, next): Fetches a specific subscription by ID for the authenticated user.
- getUserSubscriptions(req, res, next): Fetches all subscriptions for a specific user.
- createSubscription(req, res, next): Creates a new subscription for the authenticated user.
- cancelSubscription(req, res, next): Cancels a specific subscription.
- renewSubscription(req, res, next): Renews a specific subscription, extending its renewal date.
- changeSubscriptionPlan(req, res, next): Changes the subscription plan (e.g., upgrading or downgrading).
- updateSubscriptionDetails(req, res, next): Updates details like payment method, frequency, etc., for an existing subscription.

## Middleware
### Authentication Middleware (authorizeUser)
- This middleware checks if the user is authenticated. It verifies the JWT token sent in the request headers and ensures that the user is authorized to access the requested resource.
### Error Handling Middleware
- If an error occurs during any operation (e.g., validation errors, MongoDB errors, etc.), the error-handling middleware catches the error and sends an appropriate response to the client.


## Running the Application Locally
### Requirements:
- Node.js: Version 14 or higher
- MongoDB: Running locally or use a cloud database service like MongoDB Atlas.

## Future Enhancements
- Rate Limiting: Implement rate-limiting middleware to prevent abuse.
- Email Notifications: Integrate with email services to send renewal and cancellation 
notifications.
- Payment Integration: Integrate with a payment gateway (like Stripe) to handle subscriptions and payments.
